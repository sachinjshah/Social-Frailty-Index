Shah_et_al_Social_Vulnerability_Index (Work in Progress)

We are developing a mortality prediction model using Health and Retirement Survey (HRS)'s psychosocial survey 
and medicare data (subcohort to obtain Charlson and compare our model's prediction performance to Charlson's)
(1) Cleaning data (baseline at 2010) 
(2) Variable selection (LASSO) and coefficient estimating (Logistic Regression)
(3) Testing the model using 2012 data
